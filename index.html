			<h2> Spreadsheet Website </h2>
			<h3> Background & Usage</h3>
			<p>
			This is an experiment of mine, inspired by the article <a href="https://coderwall.com/p/duapqq/use-a-google-spreadsheet-as-your-json-backend">Use a Google Spreadsheet as your JSON backend</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
			If you do not see a button that says "Start application," then you are on an incompatible browser and/or have js disabled, and this will not work for you. Please try a compatible browser (or one with js enabled).
			</p>
			<p>
			When you click "Start application," you will be asked for two things:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Do you want to autostart the application on your next visit?</li>
				<li>What is your Google Spreadsheet backend key?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
			Both of these choices will be saved to the localStorage of the browser on your device, and will not be asked again.
			</p>
			<p>

			note: currently, there is no user-friendly way to reset these values once they're set, so make sure you enter the right ones!
=======
			You can reset these values with the button prominently displayed

			<h3> Format of Google Spreadsheet </h3>
			<p>
			The google spreadsheet must be publically accessible, as per the instructions in the article referenced in the previous section.
			</p>
			<p>
			The format of the spreadsheet is the following:
			</p>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>
					local_name
					</th>
					<th>
					parent
					</th>
					<th>
					type
					</th>
					<th>
					id
					</th>
					<th>
					classes
					</th>
					<th>
					innerHTML
					</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>
					container
					</td>
					<td></td>
					<td>
					div
					</td>
					<td>
					container
					</td>
					<td>
					these are class names
					</td>
					<td>
					This is the contents of an element
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>
					another_el
					</td>
					<td>
					container
					</td>
					<td>
					div
					</td>
					<td></td>
					<td></td>
					<td>
					This is a child element of the previous one
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>

				This page will grab the sheet in the format specified from a user-specified gs key. Then it will parse the spreadsheet contents for the cel definitions, create the html elements, and append them to the document.

			<h3>Ok, so a quick lowdown:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>SpreadSHeet ELement</li>
				<li>Will make an ajax call to a google spreadsheet</li>
				<li>The sheet will contain json objects for a Cel</li>
				<li>A Cel is created using the Cel.js library</li>
				<li>The Cel.js library enables strictly defining each element in a page, from its attributes, to its style, to its behaviour, all together, all while still enforcing modularity</li>
			</ul>
